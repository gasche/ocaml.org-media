Core is Jane Street's alternative to the OCaml standard library. The need for
an alternative to the standard library is clear: OCaml's standard library is
well implemented, but it's narrow in scope, and somewhat idiosyncratic in its
interfaces.

Core's origin's date back 10 years, to the first uses of OCaml at Jane Street.
Today, Core is at the base of the multi-million-line OCaml codebase at Jane
Street, which is actively used by on the order of a hundred people at Jane
Street for their daily work.

The talk will provide a brief overview of the design principles behind core,
including our approaches to:

   - building consistent and interoperable interfaces
   - error handling
   - naming
   - organization of types, values and and modules

We'll also discuss the the internal and community process surrounding Core,
including how contributions from external providers are handled, and how our
own internal Q/A process works.
